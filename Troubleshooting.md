# Troubleshooting

## Project does not build

It's possible that the project will not build at first try. This might be due to caching issues of some sort.
Please try the following steps in sequential order:

1. Clean the build folder (**⇧⌘K**)
2. Reset package caches using `File > Packages > Reset Package Caches`
3. Clear the `DerivedData` folder which is usually located in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode`
4. Make sure `SwiftLint` is installed on your machine. See [SwiftLint](./Code-Style#swiftlint) for more information.
5. Restart Xcode.
6. Restart your Mac.

If none of the above mentioned steps work please have a chat with us in the `help` channel on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vChUXVf9Em).

## SwiftLint

### Trailing Whitespace Violation

This is an error generated by [SwiftLint](./Code-Style#swiftlint). It means that there are `space` characters after the last statement of the line. Delete all `spaces` to get rid of this error.

> **Recommended:** Go to Xcode's `Preferences > Text Editing > Editing` and enable:
>
> - [x] Automatically trim trailing whitespace
>   - [x] Including whitespace-only lines

### Vertical Whitespace Violation

This is an error generated by [SwiftLint](./Code-Style#swiftlint). It means that there is more than one empty line between to statements. Delete all but one empty lines to get rid of this error.

## SwiftUI Preview Not Working

You may have noticed that SwiftUI does not work out of the box with `CodeEdit`.

> Previews will not work in very large and complicated views such as `WorkspaceView`

### Previews in `CodeEditModules`

When working on a specific module in `CodeEditModules` just change the run target to the specific module, then make a clean build and Previews should work instantly.

![Select Run Target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9460130/163902910-d99487b0-e7cd-4948-84d8-061c864b93d7.png)

### Previews in `CodeEdit``

When working on the main target of CodeEdit it becomes a little more complicated: Go to `CodeEdit > Targets > CodeEdit > Signing & Capabilities > Signing`.

![Select Main Target `CodeEdit`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9460130/163903142-7cf14b18-67d5-49b7-953d-a223b084621c.png)

There select your personal `Team` and change the `Signing Certificate` to `Development`.

![Select Team ID & Signing Certificate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9460130/163903188-2ae2c683-9d31-4051-b08a-57a59d44df5e.png)

Previews should now work in most views.

> Before submitting a PR please change back the Team to `None` and the Signing Certificate to `Sign to Run Locally`!
