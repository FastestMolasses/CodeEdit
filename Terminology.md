| Workspace          | A workspace is a single instance of a CodeEdit window that represents one open project. You can have multiple workspaces open with one project each.                                                                                 |
| Project            | A project is the content you load into a workspace. It is what the workspace represents.                                                                                                                                             |

| Navigator Area     | The navigator sidebar sits on the leading edge of the workspace window and is used to navigate through the project. It contains the `Project Navigator`, `Find Navigator`, `Extension Navigator`, and more.                          |
| Navigator          | An item within the navigator sidebar.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Toolbar            | The toolbar is the top most part of the workspace window. It contains buttons for toggling the sidebars, the branch selector, and other toolbar items.                                                                               |
| Tab bar            | The tab bar sits on top of the editor and shows tabs for each opened file. Tabs can be reordered or closed. Once selecting a tab the content of the selected file will show up in the editor.                                        |
| Breadcrumbs        | The breadcrumbs navigator is located just below the tabbar and visually presents the path of the currently opened file in the project. When selecting a path section a menu appears to browse the contents of the parent directory.  |
| Activity Viewer    | The activity viewer sits in the toolbar and displays project specific information and build status.                                                                                                                                    |
| Extension          | An extension is an independent piece of code that extends the functionality of CodeEdit. Extensions are written by the community and are published to be available in the Extension Store.                                           |
| Extension Store    | A repository of all available extensions that the user can install.                                                                                                                                                                  |
