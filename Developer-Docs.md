# Developer Docs

> Please make sure that all your code in the CodeEdit project is properly document using Apple's [Documentation Guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-symbol-documentation-in-your-source-files).

## Build Locally

Currently the documentation is only available by building it locally on your machine. We will distribute it on a later date so you can easily access it on the web.

To build the documentation in Xcode simply go to `Product > Build Documentation` or by pressing `⌃ ⇧ ⌘ D`.

After Xcode is done building the documentation it should pop right up. If not just go to `Window > Developer Documentation` or press `⇧ ⌘ 0`.

There the documentation should appear right on top in the left sidebar.
